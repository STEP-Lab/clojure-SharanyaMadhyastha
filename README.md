# Assignments

These assignments are designed to help you explore the clojure standard library.

There are several functions in the namespaces assignments.conditions and assignments.lists

Implement each of the functions and write as many tests as you see fit.

## Usage

Mark the ":implemented?" field in the metadata of each function as true when you are done implementing
the function.

To run the tests use `bin/kaocha`

To run the tests in watch mode, use `bin/kaocha --watch`

To run the main, use `lein run`

`lein run` only runs the functions whose :implemented? is marked true.
